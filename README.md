Sarcasm Detection

In this project, the goal is to build a model to detect whether a sentence is sarcastic or not using Bidirectional LSTMs.
Sarcasm detection is a challenging task due to the figurative and creative nature of sarcasm in text.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to automatically identify ironic or sarcastic utterances.
